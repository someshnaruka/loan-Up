# Loan Application Project-LoanUp
This is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) with Redux state management. It also utilizes Firebase for Google authentication and Tailwind CSS for styling. The project aims to calculate the pre-assessment loan value for a business based on the last fiscal data entered by the user of the company. The loan calculation depends on the profit or loss and asset value of the company as follows:

- If the company has made a profit, a 60% loan is approved.
- If the asset value is greater than or equal to the loan amount, 100% loan is approved.
- In other cases, 20% of the loan amount is approved.

- React-Redux: Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It is used to manage the application's state, making it easier to handle complex data flows and maintain a predictable state.

- Tailwind CSS for responsive and customizable UI design.

**Backend:**

- Node.js: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. It is used to build the backend server for your application.
- Express.js: Express.js is a Node.js web application framework that simplifies the creation of APIs and routes. It is used to build the backend API for your application.

**Database**

- MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is used to store company fiscal data, user information, and other relevant data.

**Firebase Authentication**

- Firebase Authentication is a service provided by Google's Firebase platform. It offers easy-to-use authentication methods, including Google Authentication, which allows users to log in to your application using their Google accounts.


## Features
